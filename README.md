# Voice_Emotion_Detection

Thisis our MINI PROJECT, a collaborative effort involving five team members including myself, focuses on speech emotion detection. 
We utilized the TESS Toronto emotional speech set data. Our approach encompasses data preprocessing, 
feature extraction using MFCC, and model training employing an LSTM neural network. The resulting model accurately predicts emotions from audio,
as validated by various classification metrics and visualization techniques such as waveplots and spectrograms. A user-friendly web interface was designed for recording, 
playing, and predicting emotions from audio files. The application's functionality is demonstrated through HTML code featuring interactive elements.
This comprehensive project showcases our team's proficiency in machine learning, audio processing, and web development, and sets a foundation for real-world emotion analysis applications.
