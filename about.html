        <p>
          Voice Emotion Detection is an innovative application that leverages machine learning and audio processing techniques to analyze and interpret human emotions from voice recordings. The system can accurately detect and classify various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more, based on the patterns and characteristics present in the recorded audio.
        </p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
          The Voice Emotion Detection system utilizes a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of voice samples labeled with corresponding emotions. The model extracts relevant features from the audio signals, such as pitch, tone, and intensity, and applies advanced algorithms to classify the emotional state of the speaker.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Team</h2>
